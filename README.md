## Overview

This challenge was a lot of fun personally.

## My process

I started first with a "mobile first" concept, building up for a viewport of 375 px width and then adding two breakpoints through media queries.

The layout was created with flex for the small width and with grid for the breakpoints

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to work "mobile first" and work with breakpoints and fluid measurements. Was a lot o fun. 

Improved the skills on how to size and fit everything in place in the cointainers (for the grid and flex)

### Continued development

Still want to learn how to work more properly with grid and flex, with fluids measurements, and responsive desing.
